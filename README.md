# Innovation Factory

## Accelerating AI Innovation Within Your Enterprise

The **Innovation Factory** is a complimentary 10-day development engagement designed to help organizations drive AI adoption, deliver innovation, and solve critical business needs through custom prototypes built by Microsoft technical experts. This hands-on program bridges the gap between AI strategy and implementation, delivering tangible business value while accelerating your team's AI capabilities.

Through this engagement, Microsoft's technical experts collaborate with your team to identify high-impact opportunities, design solutions, and build functional prototypes that demonstrate the power of AI-driven innovation. The program focuses on delivering real business outcomes—improved developer productivity, enhanced code quality, and measurable impact on your organization's strategic objectives—while providing your team with practical experience and solid, reliable code.

## Program Overview

The Innovation Factory follows a structured 10-day process:

1. **Identify an Opportunity** (1 Day) - Strategy briefing with Microsoft experts to identify innovation opportunities and craft solutions
2. **Build a Prototype** (2-4 Days) - Microsoft technical experts build a functional prototype based on agreed-upon requirements
3. **Validate the Solution** (1-2 Days) - Testing in a sandboxed environment with feedback sessions to refine the solution
4. **Implement Improvements** (1-2 Days) - Critical changes implemented based on initial feedback
5. **Evaluate Outcomes** (1 Day) - Post-mortem review with documentation and next steps identification
6. **Hand Off Deliverables** - Complete transfer to your internal team, Microsoft customer success team, and preferred partners

## Current Projects

The Innovation Factory has delivered innovative solutions across various Microsoft technologies. Below is a list of projects that demonstrate the program's capabilities.
